It is easy to get lost in the vast world of GitHub, so we thought it would be beneficial to create a centralized ground for users to post projects and applications that are exclusively open to collaboration. Users are able to explore repositories posted by other users, save those repositories, and add their own repositories all within a simple and intuitive environment."
